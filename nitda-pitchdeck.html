            <h2 class="title">The Problem</h2>
            <p class="text">The current state of ride hailing in Nigeria is plagued by high costs, inefficiency, and discomfort. Inflation has made popular ride-hailing apps like Bolt and Uber expensive for the average citizen. The 'along' option, while affordable, offers a subpar experience, wasting valuable time and effort.</p>
